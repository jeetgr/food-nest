## Customer Page

Order Tracking & History
Priority: High
Status: Backend exists (listMine), UI needs verification.
Goal: Ensure the "Orders" tab correctly lists past orders and shows their live status (e.g., "Preparing", "Out for Delivery").

Profile Editing
Priority: Medium
Status: View-only (likely).
Goal: Allow users to update their Name, Phone Number, and potentially Password.
